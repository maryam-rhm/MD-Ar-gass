# MD-Ar-gass
This code will simulate molecular dynamic for N Argon gass molecules in determined temp and box, with calculating Lennard-Jones term and velocity-Verlet algorithm to integrate Newton equation. This code will write out the energies, positions, and temperature every 100 steps in a csv file, and the python code will plot trajectories. The energies, and temperture will plot as a function of time.
