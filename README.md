# MD-Ar-gass
# This code will simulate molecular dynamic for N Argon gass molecules
# in determined temp and box, with calculating Lennard-Jones term and 
# velocity-Verlet algorithm to integrate Newton equation.
# This code will write out the energies, positions, and temperature 
# every 100 steps in a csv file, and the python code will plot trajectories.
# The energies, and temperture will plot as a function of time.
